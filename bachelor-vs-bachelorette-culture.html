        Charleston, South Carolina, has mastered the art of celebration. With its walkable downtown, beach access, and endless party venues, it’s no surprise that both bachelor and bachelorette groups have claimed it as their playground. But while the two weekends share the same city, their vibes couldn’t be more different.

    <!-- BACHELORETTE CULTURE -->
    <section class="bachelorette container">
      <h2>The Bachelorette Vibe</h2>
      <p>
        Bachelorette weekends in Charleston are all about fun, flair, and photo ops. Think pastel outfits, themed parties, and private entertainment in beach rentals or luxury lofts downtown. 
        Groups often start with brunch on King Street, follow up with sunset cocktails, and end the night with a private show from <strong>Michael After Dark</strong> — where the focus is laughter, excitement, and a touch of Charleston charm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The city’s hospitality scene caters beautifully to brides-to-be, offering private dining, rooftop spaces, and exclusive entertainment that turns a simple night into a story worth retelling.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- BACHELOR CULTURE -->
    <section class="bachelor container">
      <h2>The Bachelor Scene</h2>
      <p>
        Bachelor groups tend to chase a different rhythm — golf courses, breweries, and late-night lounges that mix camaraderie with celebration. Many prefer Charleston’s rooftop bars or private villas outside the main downtown area for a more contained party experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        For private events, <strong>Michael After Dark</strong> can match that same exclusivity with curated entertainment that keeps the evening classy, private, and perfectly tailored for adult groups.

    <!-- COMPARISON / CULTURE BLEND -->
    <section class="comparison container">
      <h2>How the Two Cultures Collide</h2>
      <p>
        What’s unique about Charleston is that bachelor and bachelorette parties often cross paths — whether it’s on King Street, at the beach, or even in shared rental villas. This overlap has created a culture that’s playful, social, and surprisingly balanced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where other cities lean toward chaos, Charleston blends southern elegance with a fun-loving energy. Private shows, coordinated themes, and shared experiences make it easy for both groups to celebrate in style without losing the local charm that defines the city.
