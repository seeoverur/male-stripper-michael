  <!-- King Street Scene -->
  <section class="container py-5 border-bottom">
    <div class="row align-items-center g-5">

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">King Street Vibes</h2>
        <p>Charleston’s King Street is the pulse of the city at night — neon lights, open-air balconies, and music pouring from rooftop lounges. Locals mix with travelers, bridal parties toast champagne, and the whole scene feels alive. It’s the kind of place where the night never really ends, it just shifts to a new rhythm.</p>
        <p>Michael After Dark blends perfectly into that rhythm — the performer who embodies the energy of Charleston nightlife and brings it straight to your private venue. Whether your group spends the evening bar-hopping downtown or hosting a private show afterward, Michael’s performances mirror that same citywide spark.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Folly Beach After Dark</h2>
        <p>Just a few miles from downtown Charleston, Folly Beach offers a laid-back party scene with salt air, live bands, and moonlight over the pier. It’s not just about beach bars — it’s about that easy, coastal energy that makes every night feel like summer.</p>
        <p>For bachelorette groups and house rentals near the shore, Michael brings the excitement directly to you. Whether it’s a show by the pool deck or an intimate performance indoors, his energy fits seamlessly into Folly’s playful, carefree vibe.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Mount Pleasant Evenings</h2>
        <p>Across the Ravenel Bridge, Mount Pleasant offers a more refined but equally lively nightlife — rooftop cocktails, local breweries, and waterfront bars that glow under string lights. It’s where locals unwind after a long day, and it’s also where Michael calls home.</p>
        <p>Private shows here often take place in homes or upscale rentals, where guests want that personal, memorable entertainment experience. Whether it’s a low-key birthday or a surprise event, Michael’s professionalism and charisma make him the highlight of the evening.</p>

        <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Isle of Palms & Beach Bar Nights</h2>
        <p>The Windjammer on Isle of Palms is legendary — live music, sand between your toes, and a full crowd every weekend. It’s that blend of beach party and local tradition that defines Lowcountry nightlife.</p>
        <p>Michael After Dark’s private events on the island capture that same excitement in a more exclusive way. Imagine bringing the energy of The Windjammer into your beach rental — the lights, the music, and a show that turns your group’s weekend into a story worth retelling.</p>
